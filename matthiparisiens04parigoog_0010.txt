rho works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
testing upon the editorS, who were to be ehosen by the
Master oi the Rolls with the sanction ol the Treasury.

The Iords ol Her Majesty's lheasury, citer a careful Ἰ
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasu'ry Minuta, dated February 9,1857, that the plan

recommended by the Master of the Bolls ‘³ was well
ealcrdated for the accomplishment of this important
, national object, in an effeetual and satisfactory manner,
withinareasonable time, and provided proper attentionbe
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements‚
without unnecessary expense.'’

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that

each chroniele and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text oi each writer, derived from acollation of the
best Mss, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, abiographieel account of the author,
so iar as authentic materiale existed for that purpose,
and an estimate of his historical credibility and velue.
